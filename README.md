# whiskey-friskey

There have been many previous attempts to make physical robot whiskers that are modelled on those of a rat but these have been closed source systems.

We would like to create an open source hardware (OSH) version.

Our aim is a well documented, low-cost, and easy to build OSH system. Additionally, we attempt to infer whisker contact location using beam theory.

The project will contain CAD files, build instructions, software for inference, and hardware files for the whisker unit.
